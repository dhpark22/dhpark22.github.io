Subspace clustering is the problem of fitting a collection of high-dimensional data points to a /union of subspaces/. This problem can be regarded as ``Mixture of PCA'' because the points are to be partitioned into subsets each of which is modeled by a low-dimensional subspace. This model naturally arises in settings where data from multiple latent phenomena are mixed together and need to be separated.

Recent algorithms for subspace clustering are based on two steps. \[1-3,5,6\] At the first step, a number of neighbor points are collected for each data point. Then the points are segmented using spectral clustering. (See the table below.) State-of-the-art algorithms solve a convex program with size as large as the squared number of data points. \[1-3,7\] As the amount of the data increases, the computational cost becomes critical. To reduce the cost, we proposed /greedy/ algorithms.

Our algorithms are /provable/ in the sense that the exactly correct clustering is guaranteed under certain conditions in the standard models. For example, when $L$ $d$-dimensional subspaces are drawn uniformly at random in $\mathcal{R}^p$, and $n$ random data points are iid uniformly generated on each subspace, exact clustering is guaranteed with high probability if $n = \Omega(d)$ and $\frac{d}{p} = O \left( \frac{\log n}{\log (ndL)} \right)$. This condition is no worse than the existing statistical guarantees.

In practice, our greedy algorithm, which is in general significantly faster than solving a convex program, performs competitively against the algorithms on real-world benchmark datasets. We observed that our algorithm outperforms the existing greedy algorithms. \[5,6\]

== Applications

Subspace clustering has diverse applications such as computer vision(motion segmenation, face clustering, etc), system identification, gene expression analysis.

- Motion segmentation : Given a collection of feature points extracted from a video sequence, the points of a rigidly moving object lies on a low-dimensional subspace. Based on this observation, we can segment the feature points with respect to the objects.

- Face clustering : Under varying illumination conditions, the images of a face can be modeled by a low-dimensional subspace. Using subspace clustering algorithms, we can segment the images of different faces with respect to the faces.
