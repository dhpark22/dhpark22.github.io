Subspace clustering is the problem of fitting a collection of high-dimensional data points to a /union of subspaces/. This problem can be regarded as ``Mixture of PCA'' because the points are to be partitioned into subsets each of which is modeled by a low-dimensional subspace. This model naturally arises in settings where data from multiple latent phenomena are mixed together and need to be separated.

State-of-the-art algorithms for subspace clustering are based on solving a convex program with size as large as the squared number of data points \[1-3\]. As the amount of the data increases, the computational cost becomes critical. To reduce the cost, we proposed /greedy algorithms/ for the problem.

Our algorithms are /provable/ in the sense that the exactly correct clustering is guaranteed under certain conditions in the standard models. For example, when $L$ $d$-dimensional subspaces are drawn uniformly at random in $\mathcal{R}^p$, and $n$ random data points are iid uniformly generated on each subspace, exact clustering is guaranteed with high probability if $n = \Omega(d)$ and $\frac{d}{p} = O \left( \frac{\log n}{\log (ndL)} \right)$. This condition is no worse than the existing statistical guarantees.

In practice, our greedy algorithm, which is in general significantly faster than solving a convex program, performs competitively against the state-of-the-art algorithms in real applications such as motion segmentation and face clustering.

== Applications

Subspace clustering has diverse applications such as computer vision(motion segmenation, face clustering, etc), system identification, gene expression analysis.

- Motion segmentation : Given a collection of feature points extracted from a video sequence, the points of a rigidly moving object lies on a low-dimensional subspace. Based on this observation, we can segment the feature points with respect to the objects.

- Face clustering : Under varying illumination conditions, the images of a face can be modeled by a low-dimensional subspace. Using subspace clustering algorithms, we can segment the images of different faces with respect to the faces.
